# EDAN
 
# How to Run

This application is designed to run in a PyTorch environment. To execute `main.py`, which is the entry point of the program, follow the steps outlined below.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

1. **Python:** The code is tested with Python 3.8. It should be compatible with most Python 3.x versions.

2. **PyTorch:** This project requires PyTorch. If you haven't installed PyTorch yet, you can find installation instructions on the [official PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).


## Running main.py

Once you have the environment set up, you can run `main.py` by following these steps:

1. Open your command line interface (CLI).

2. Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.

3. Select the network. You can select the correspoding testing model such as 'EDAN/IA_EDAN/IE_EDAN/EEGNet/DDC/DeepCoral.etc' with the setting in 'main.py':

   ```bash
    Net_number = 'EDAN' # Choose EDAN model
    ```
   
5. Run the script with the command:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
